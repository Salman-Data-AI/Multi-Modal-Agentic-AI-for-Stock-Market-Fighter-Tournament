When given a company ticker symbol or name, create a detailed fighter character profile including:
1. Fighter name and dark/mysterious backstory with corporate themes
2. Brutal fighting style and signature finishing moves
3. Strengths based on company advantages (presented as combat abilities)
4. Weaknesses based on company vulnerabilities (presented as combat weaknesses)
5. A menacing catchphrase or battle cry
6. Detailed physical appearance description emphasizing combat gear, scars, weapons, and intimidating features

Make the character dark, gritty, and intimidating while still being educational about the company's business model. Think corporate warfare meets martial arts tournament. Keep responses engaging and around 300-400 words with emphasis on combat details."""
